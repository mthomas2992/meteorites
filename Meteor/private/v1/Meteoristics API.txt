##What is this API?

The Meteoristics API is a RESTful web API that is intended to offer statistics in multiple areas.
It achieves this through interfacing with the Australian Bureau of Statistics API which can be found here <http://stat.data.abs.gov.au/> .

[2]:?ver=v1&endpoint=isApiAlive


###Current Level of implementation

Currently the API fulfills all requirements of the specification given and returns
all nessasary data for both merchandise exports and retail turnover. As these
have been completed development will focus now on creating more endpoints and features
within the actual endpoints themselves


###How to use the API

The meteoristics API is a standard REST API, in that you make requests to our endpoints
and we return data to you. Currently we only support the get request type, as we
have not needed any other types as of yet. Specific information about how to pass
specific variables to endpoints are defined on their respective page as they require different paramaters to function

But in general a request is made by using any web browser or http client (such as cURL or google chrome). Using these clients
you type in the applicable URL, which will be of the following format


```md
http://meteoristics.com/api/<version of api you are wanting to use (in this case "v1")>/<endpoint you wish to use here>?<variables you wish to pass here>
```
You then change the applicable parts of the URL as needed then make the request. Our server will then interpret your request and return data to you in the JSON format.


For example, if you were using the cURL client you would run the following command in your unix terminal prompt to make a query to the endpoint retailTrade
and pass the variables


+ statisticsArea = Retail


+ state = NSW


+ category = total


+ startDate = 2015-09-09


+ endDate = 2016-09-09



```md
curl -X GET http://meteoristics.com/api/v1/retailTrade?statisticsArea=Retail&state=nsw&category=Total&startDate=2015-09-09&endDate=2016-09-09
```


The returned JSON will also always be in the same general format of

```md
status: {
  requirements: <an arrayrequired variables for the endpoint you requested>
  passedParamaters: <object contained the variables you did send to us>
  errors:< an array of any errors preventing execution>
  warnings:<an array of any warnings that aren't preventing execution of your query but should be corrected>
  executionTime: <data relating to the time and speed of your requested query>
}
data: <actual requested data or error string>
info: <appendixed data about our API and its version>
```

In the case that relevant statistical data is not provided from the ABS API, nothing will be returned for that part of the query or the data will have the field "data missing"

As you can see, specific details as to why you are not recieving your expected output can be found in the errors array. Warnings tend to be as a result of passing a non-nessasary variable to us


###System integration

Any system can integrate with our API as long as they are able to make standard HTTP requests. By then following the request formats specified by each endpoint you can
fully utilise our API in almost any environment (as long as it also has an internet connection of course). Our API follows the HTTP RESTful format completely. We do not use
any authentication.
